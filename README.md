# IoT-Autonomous-Robocar
Its an IoT project using Raspberry Pi and Arduino 


As the title says, I am building an Autonomous Robo-car that drives on it's own. While driving, it detects various things on it's own and behaves as a human would behave. 
To elaborate a bit on that, if it detects the traffic signal to be red, it stops on it's own. 
Similarly, if it detects an obstacle, it takes a left/right in order to overtake the next vehicle/obstacle and keeps moving ahead. 
Furthermore, if there is a "STOP" sign, the vehicle stops for a designated amount of time and then starts to proceed again
